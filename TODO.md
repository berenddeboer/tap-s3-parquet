### TODO
* Tests
* Mechanism to auto-select streams? (catalog.json -> streams[n].metadata[0].metadata.selected = true)?
* Mutually exclusive cli options fail sanely
* Handle empty or missing state file?
* Log record numbers (total/table/file?)
* Test bookmark support
* Log skipped columns
* Run through singer.io best practices to make sure we're hitting all the marks
* Do a fresh install to make sure project.toml has all deps
